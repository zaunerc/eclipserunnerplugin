   <description>
      The Eclipse Runner plugin improves the way how one can execute
launch configurations from inside the Eclipse IDE. The plugin
adds a new &quot;Runner&quot; view, which allows the user to categorize,
bookmark and organize launch configurations in groups. Launch
configurations can be executed directly from the view by double
clicking on the icon of the launch configuration.
